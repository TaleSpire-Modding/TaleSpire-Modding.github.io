## Welcome to TaleSpire Modding
Welcome to the start of Modding Talespire.
This site is currently WIP as we're collating our research.

### TaleWeaver
TaleWeaver is currently not released as of yet. Due to this the modding community has created their own flow called EARCMPEAL (pronounced "here, simple") which allows currently the import of custom minis and in the future Tiles and Props.

### EAR + CMP + EAL
EAR, CMP, and EAL are plugins that are currently in use whilst we do not have TaleWeaver. Upon TaleWeaver release it will be determined if we continue supporting this tool or to adopt TaleWeaver. 

### Bepinex + Harmony
Plugins are currently being created via Bepinx and Harmony frameworks enabling injection of custom code into TaleSpire.

### Support or Contact
Mods are uploaded to [Thunderstore](Talespire.thunderstore.io/) upon release. We also have a [discord](https://discord.gg/vH2Ge6KsjW) where you can chat with mod developers or join the community and get into creating your own mods.
